Behaim uses Java reflection to explore an domain model up to a configurable recursion depth. The resulting meta data
can then be used by pluggable visitors. 

As a proof of concept, Behaim currently comes with a builder visitor that allows for the creation of randomly populated 
object graphs which may be useful for performance tests.

# Features
- Multi-threaded graph exploration
- Re-use of meta data about an already explored object graph
- Extensible with custom visitors. Already comes with a visitor to create a randomly populated object graph.

# Builder Usage

Default configuration
```
Foo foo = Builder.make(Foo.class);
Collection<Foo> foos = Builder.make(Foo.class, 100);
```

Custom configuration
```
Config config = new Config(...);
Foo foo = Builder.make(Foo.class, config);
Collection<Foo> foos = Builder.make(Foo.class, config, 100);
```

Repeated builds
When you need to repeatedly create objects with the same configuration, use the instance make method.
```
Builder builder = new Builder(Foo.class);
Collection<Foo> foos1 = builder.make(100);
Collection<Foo> foos2 = builder.make(50);
```
